<div id="cold" style="text-align:center;"><h2 style= "color:#0000FF">Cooling</h2>

Central air conditioning helps keep your environment cool and reduces humidity levels. As the central air conditioning system draws air out
of various rooms in your house or business through return air ducts, the air is pulled through an air filter, which removed airborne particles
such as dust and lint. The filtered air is then routed to air supply ductwork that carries it back to the rooms.</div>
